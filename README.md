# Domain Expert Model on AWS SageMaker

## Project Overview

This project is my **Final Project for Udacity's Generative AI with AWS course**. It focuses on developing a **financial domain-specific language model** by fine-tuning Meta's Llama 2 7B model on a dataset tailored to the finance dataset provided. 

## Objectives

**Fine-Tune the Model**: Utilize **Amazon SageMaker** and other AWS tools to customize the pre-trained Llama 2 7B model for the financial domain.
**Domain Expertise**: Train the model on a financial dataset, enhancing its understanding of finance-specific language and concepts.
**AWS Tools**: Gained hands-on experience with **Amazon SageMaker** within a **$25 budget**.
**Trained Model**: A fine-tuned language model proficient in the financial domain.
**Training the Model**: Set up an AWS environment, deployed Amazon SageMaker, and fine-tuned the Meta Llama 2 7B model within the course's budget constraints.


## Conclusion

This project successfully fine-tuned Meta's Llama 2 7B model to act as a financial domain expert, providing accurate and relevant responses to finance-related questions. By working within a $25 AWS budget, created a model that can enhance customer interactions, improve information delivery, and support content creation for financial topics.
